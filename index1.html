                            The archaeological site prediction model integrates Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize how archaeologists identify and preserve historically significant sites. Traditional methods of discovery, which rely on manual surveys and excavations, are time-consuming and resource-intensive. By using machine learning algorithms trained on environmental factors—such as topography, soil composition, and proximity to water—along with historical data, the model can predict potential archaeological sites with greater accuracy. This AI-driven approach enhances the ability to detect undiscovered sites, particularly in areas threatened by development or environmental changes, ensuring better protection and preservation of cultural heritage.                        </p>

        <div class=""><div class="m-lg-5 m-4 flex-fill"><h1 class="fw-bold">How it works?</h1><br>
        <p>The archaeological prediction model was implemented using the Deepness plugin in QGIS, with key factors such as distance from water bodies, elevation, microlandforms, and terrain ruggedness being considered. These environmental and spatial features were processed and analyzed within QGIS, forming the basis for training the neural network. The model was designed to recognize patterns in the landscape that correlate with potential archaeological sites. By utilizing the Deepness plugin, predictions were generated and visualized, allowing researchers to identify areas with high archaeological significance based on these crucial factors."</p>

      <p>
        the area of interest chosen is The Gulf of Kutch region attracted early settlers due to its rich natural resources, including fertile land and abundant marine life. Its strategic location along trade routes facilitated economic exchanges and cultural interactions, making it an ideal site for community establishment.</p>

      <p>
        Factors like proximity to water, elevation, microlandforms, and terrain ruggedness play a significant role in predicting archaeological site locations. Early human settlements often formed near water sources for drinking, farming, and transportation, while moderate elevations provided protection from flooding and harsh climates. Fertile soil and flatter terrains favored agriculture, while rugged areas could offer natural defense. The map made by our ml model highlights areas with a high probability of containing excavated sites based on these factors, allowing researchers to focus on regions with the greatest archaeological potential.      </p>
